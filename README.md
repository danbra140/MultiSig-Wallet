## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MultiSig-Wallet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=your_multisig_program_id
```

### Network Configuration
The wallet is configured for Solana Devnet by default. To switch to mainnet:

1. Update the network in `components/WalletProvider.tsx`
2. Change the RPC endpoint in your environment variables
3. Update the program ID for mainnet deployment

4. **Execution**: Execute transaction when threshold is met
5. **Confirmation**: Confirm transaction on blockchain

### Adding/Removing Signers
1. **Propose Change**: Create proposal to modify signers
2. **Approval Process**: Existing signers approve the change
3. **Execution**: Update wallet configuration on-chain
4. **Verification**: Confirm changes are applied correctly
